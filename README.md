# Hiya, I'm Sirish Visweswar üëã  

I‚Äôm a graduate student in **Computer Science at NYU Tandon**, and currently a **Computational Neuroscience Researcher at the Neuroinformatics Lab with Prof. Erdem Varol**. My work focuses on **cross-modal foundation models** and **multimodal translation architectures** that connect EEG and fMRI data.  

I‚Äôve always been curious by nature and love diving into new areas‚Äîwhether through research, side projects, or creative hobbies. My primary interests sit at the intersection of **deep learning, computer vision, and neuroscience**, but I‚Äôve also dabbled in **reinforcement learning, game development, blockchain, and NLP**.  

Before NYU, I completed my **undergrad thesis at Nanyang Technological University, Singapore**, working on text augmentation and **LLM-based paraphrasing for Named Entity Recognition**. I also **published a paper in IEEE Sensors Letters** on deep learning for **ECG-based myocardial infarction detection**.  

Outside of tech, I enjoy creating art, which keeps me grounded and feeds into my problem-solving style‚Äîa mix of **creativity, structure, and curiosity**.
